1. Create 4 boxes and center them on the screen both vertically and horizontally.
2. Add a circle in the top left corner of the first box.
3. Make the circle move around the perimeter of the containing square clockwise.
    3.1 Start at the top left corner
    3.2 Move to the top right corner
    3.3 Move to the bottom right corner
    3.4 Move to the bottom left corner
    3.5 Move back to the top left corner
    3.6 Repeat
4. Add a circle in the center of the second box.
5. Make the circle change to a white square, then rotate, then change back.
    5.1 Start with border radius 50% and red color
    5.2 Change border radius to 0, color to white
    5.3 Rotate 90deg
    5.4 Change border radius back to 50% and color back to red
    5.5 Repeat
6. Add two half-circles in the center of the third box to form a full circle.
7. Make both halves of the circle move apart horizontally, then come back together.
    7.1 Start with both halves adjacent to make a circle
    7.2 Move both halves away from each other
    7.3 Move both halves back into a circle
    7.4 Repeat
8. Add a circle in the center of the fourth box.
9. Make the circle rapidly grow and shrink twice, then wait, then rapidly grow and shrink once more.

    9.2 Scale up the circle then immediately scale it back down
    9.3 Repeat immediately
    9.4 Wait until just before the end of animation
    9.5 Scale up the circle then immediately scale it back down
    9.6 Repeat immediately
